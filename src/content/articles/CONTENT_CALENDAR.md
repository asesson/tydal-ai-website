## Week 1: Getting Started
### Title: "How Do I Know If My Business Is Ready for AI?"
**Category:** Getting Started
**Read Time:** 6 min
**Featured:** Yes

**TLDR Summary:** Assess AI readiness across five dimensions: data quality, process documentation, team capacity, budget allocation, and leadership commitment. Businesses ready for AI have documented workflows, clean data in 2+ systems, allocated $15K+ budget, and executive sponsorship.

**Key Points:**
- Data readiness: Can you export data from existing systems in consistent formats?
- Process maturity: Are workflows documented and repeatable, or ad-hoc and variable?
- Resource availability: Do you have 10+ hours/week for implementation support?
- Success metrics: Can you define and measure specific improvement targets?
- Leadership buy-in: Is there executive support and willingness to adapt processes?

**Key Points:**
- Operational data: Transaction logs, customer communications, process timestamps
- Contextual data: Business rules, approval workflows, priority scoring criteria
- Outcome data: Quality scores, customer satisfaction ratings, efficiency metrics

## Week 5: Advanced Strategies
### Title: "How Can AI Reduce Customer Support Response Times by 70%?"
**Category:** Advanced Strategies
**Read Time:** 8 min
**Featured:** No

**TLDR Summary:** AI reduces support response times through intelligent ticket routing (30% faster), automated response drafting (50% faster), knowledge base search (60% faster), and sentiment-based prioritization (40% improvement). Implement progressively starting with routing and search.

**Key Points:**
- Intelligent routing: Classify tickets by type, urgency, and expertise required; route to optimal agent
- Response drafting: AI generates initial responses based on knowledge base and ticket history
- Knowledge base search: Automatically find relevant articles and solutions for agent reference
- Sentiment analysis: Prioritize frustrated or urgent customers automatically
- Progressive implementation: Start with routing, add search, then response drafting

## Week 6: Business Value
### Title: "What's the Break-Even Point for AI Investments in SMBs?"
**Category:** Business Value
**Read Time:** 7 min
**Featured:** No

**TLDR Summary:** Most SMB AI implementations break even in 3-9 months depending on scope. A $25K investment that saves 15 hours/week at $50/hour fully loaded cost breaks even in 8.3 months. Factor in implementation time, training, and ongoing maintenance costs.

**Key Points:**
- Typical investment range: $15K-$50K for initial implementation, $500-$2K/month ongoing
- Time savings calculation: Hours saved ร fully loaded hourly rate = monthly savings
- Break-even formula: Total investment รท monthly savings = months to break-even
- Hidden costs: Training time (20-40 hours), data preparation (40-80 hours), integration work
- Accelerators: Clean data, documented processes, and engaged teams shorten payback periods

## Week 7: Getting Started
### Title: "Which AI Use Cases Deliver the Fastest ROI for SMBs?"
**Category:** Getting Started
**Read Time:** 6 min
**Featured:** Yes

**TLDR Summary:** Fastest ROI comes from high-volume, low-complexity tasks: invoice processing (2-3 month payback), email classification (1-2 months), meeting transcription (2-4 months), customer data entry (3-5 months), and basic customer support routing (2-3 months).

**Key Points:**
- Invoice/document processing: 80%+ time savings, 2-3 month payback, minimal process change required

## Week 8: Best Practices
### Title: "What Questions Should I Ask AI Vendors Before Signing a Contract?"
**Category:** Best Practices
**Read Time:** 8 min
**Featured:** No

**TLDR Summary:** Ask 25 critical questions across five categories: security and compliance (data handling, certifications), pricing and costs (hidden fees, scaling costs), implementation and support (timeline, training, SLAs), integration and customization (API access, data portability), and performance guarantees (accuracy SLAs, failure handling).

**Key Points:**
- Security: Where is data stored? What certifications do you have? How long is data retained?
- Pricing: What are all costs (setup, monthly, per-transaction)? What happens if we exceed limits?
- Implementation: What's the realistic timeline? Who provides training? What's included in support?
- Integration: Do you have APIs? Can we export our data? What systems integrate natively?
- Performance: What accuracy guarantees do you provide? What happens when the system fails?
