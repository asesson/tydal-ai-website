## Content Guidelines

### Title Format
**Always use question format:** "How Do I..." | "What Are..." | "Why Does..." | "When Should..."

**Good examples:**
- "How Do I Choose Between AI Platforms for My Business?"
- "What Are the Hidden Costs of AI Implementation?"
- "Why Does My Team Resist AI Adoption?"

**Bad examples:**
- "Choosing AI Platforms" (not a question)
- "The Guide to AI Implementation" (too generic)
- "AI Best Practices" (not specific enough)

### TLDR Best Practices
- Summary should answer the title question in 2-3 sentences
- Each key point should be specific and actionable
- Include numbers/percentages where possible
- Points should be scannable (can stand alone)
- Aim for 4-5 points total

### Content Structure
1. **Use clear H2 headings** for main sections
2. **Use H3 headings** for subsections within frameworks
3. **Bold key terms** and important concepts
4. **Use bullet points** for lists
5. **Include concrete examples** from real SMBs
6. **Add statistics** where relevant (cite sources)

### Voice and Tone
- **Direct and practical** - no fluff or jargon
- **Conversational but professional** - like talking to a colleague
- **Empathetic** - acknowledge the reader's challenges
- **Confident** - provide clear guidance
- **Specific** - avoid vague advice

### Word Count Targets
- Short articles: 1,200-1,800 words (5-7 min read)
- Medium articles: 1,800-2,500 words (7-10 min read)
- Long articles: 2,500-3,500 words (10-15 min read)

### SEO/LLM Optimization
1. **Question-format title** - matches how people search
2. **Clear, direct answers** - LLMs can extract easily
3. **Structured content** - headings, lists, frameworks
4. **Specific examples** - concrete details are more valuable
5. **Actionable takeaways** - what the reader should DO
6. **Internal links** - connect to related articles
7. **FAQ-style subsections** where appropriate

### Examples to Include
Every article should include:
- **At least 1-2 real-world examples** from SMBs
- **Specific numbers** (time saved, cost reduced, etc.)
- **Before/after scenarios** when relevant
- **Concrete action steps** the reader can take

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Generic advice that could apply to anything
- ❌ Overly technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Vague "best practices" without specifics
- ❌ Marketing speak or hype
- ❌ Advice without context or examples
- ❌ Lists without explanation
- ❌ Claims without evidence or examples
